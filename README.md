Coin Change Problem
===================

Introduction
------------

The objective of this lab is to implement the coin change problem using a greedy algorithm, and then using dynamic programming to solve it.

How to Run
----------

Find the source file in src/coinchange dir. Compile, and run CoinChange.java.
Both methods run, first greedy, then dp.



Analysis
--------

Due to the nature of the denominations (multiples of 5), there is never such a case where the dynamic programming algorithm produces
a more optimal result than the greedy algorithm.
